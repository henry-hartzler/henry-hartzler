## Hey there! I'm Henry, a Software Engineer :computer:

ðŸŽ“ I graduated with a Master of Science in Data Science at Eastern University, specializing in ML and NLP. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently using Python for Data Science with an emphasis on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
    
ðŸŽ“ Previously, I graduated with Honors from Nucamp Coding Bootcamp's Full Stack Web + Mobile Development Program with a focus in React, React Native, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

ðŸ”­ Additionally, I employ best practices for TypeScript, C#, and MSSQL Server for my current job as a Software Engineer.

ðŸ“± Using React Native, I built a clone of the popular climbing app, Kaya, that serves as both a guide and logbook.

âš¡ Fun fact: Before switching careers, I was a 4th-5th grade educator in a Dual-Language program (English / Spanish).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my passion for open source and my aspirations to ensure that everyone has access to an engaging and quality education.

ðŸ“« Message me on LinkedIn to learn more!
