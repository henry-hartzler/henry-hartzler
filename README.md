## Hey there! I'm Henry, a Software Developer :computer:

ðŸŽ“ I graduated with Honors from Nucamp Coding Bootcamp's Full Stack Web + Mobile Development Program with a focus in React, React Native, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning to use C# and MSSQL Server for my current job as a Software Engineer.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m developing on a learning management system app that will reinforce positive behaviors and expectations for educators in the classroom.

ðŸ“± Using React Native, I'm also building a climbing app that serves as both a guide and logbook.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my passion for open source and my aspirations to ensure that everyone has access to an engaging and quality education.

ðŸ“« Message me on LinkedIn to learn more!
